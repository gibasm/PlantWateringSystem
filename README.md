# DIY plant watering sytem

An automatic system for watering houseplants.

(this project is still in development phase)

## Materials:

- hydraulics: water bottle, plastic hose (diameter: 6mm, length: about 2 meters), electro-mechanical valve
- YL-69/38 soil moisture sensor
- Atmel ATmega88PA microcontroller with 12MHz quartz resoantor (28 PDIP package) and USBASP v2.0 programmer
- breadboard (for prototyping and programming the uC)
- bench power supply (for prototyping)
- 7805 (5V regulator for final assembly)
- IRLZ44N (MOSFET transitor for valve control)
- cabels, resistors, capacitors etc.

## Software:

- avr-gcc / avr-g++
- avrdude
- GNU Make
- other CAD/SPICE software (EasyEDA/KiCAD/Altium Designer)

## Project goals:

1. Build a functional prototype
2. Design a PCB and enclosure
3. Create a fully functioning system
